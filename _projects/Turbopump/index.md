# Intro
Inspired by another hobby rocketeer, I started this project to gain more understanding of turbopumps and produce my first prototype. Reddit user akarin9527 made a turbopump and pumped liquid oxygen to a small rocket engine.

# Impeller Design and Analysis
Targeting a pressure rise of 500 psi, a flow rate of 30 GPM, and an operation speed of 20,000 RPM, I started to roughly shape the overall dimenions of the impeller to try to acheive my goals. Iteratively drafting my basic dimentions and performing hand calculations for velocity triangles got me a pressure rise of about 501 PSI. 

The resulting impeller from hand calculations shown below:

# Volute Section
Using Bernoulli's equation and the velocities expected at the exit of the impeller and the housing, the calculated pressure delta across the housing is -0.94 PSI. Bringing the total system pressure to just over 500 PSI.

# Testing
Pressure vs RPM data was collected for various flowrates to create a pump curve.

# Results
